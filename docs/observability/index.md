This document provides an overview of how our application leverages observability techniques to provide insight into its health and performance. We utilize both logging and metrics to offer comprehensive visibility into its operation.

### Logging

Our application writes structured logs to standard error (stderr) in JSON format. This format facilitates parsing and analysis by downstream systems. We plan to employ rolling indices in Elasticsearch to ensure efficient storage and retrieval of these logs.

**Key Features:**

* **Structured JSON Format:** Enables efficient parsing and querying and also provides flexibility to easily consume logs with tools such as [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)
* **Rolling Indices in Elasticsearch:** Will be added to ensure logs gathering

### Metrics

Our application exposes operational metrics at the `/metrics` endpoint, following the Prometheus format. This allows scraping and visualization of key performance indicators within Prometheus and other compatible tools.

**Key Features:**

* **Prometheus Format:** Widely adopted and supported by various monitoring tools.
* **/metrics Endpoint:** Provides easy access to essential performance indicators.
* **Visualization & Analysis:** Enables real-time and historical performance observability and monitoring.
* **Alerting:** Enables real-time alerting based on occured problems.

### Benefits

By embracing observability practices, we achieve the following benefits:

* **Enhanced Troubleshooting:** Logs and metrics facilitate pinpointing issues and understanding application behavior.
* **Performance Monitoring:** Gain insights into resource utilization and identify potential bottlenecks.
* **Proactive Maintenance:** Identify and address potential problems before they impact users.
* **Improved User Experience:** Real-time feedback allows for quick response to user-facing issues.

This overview provides a high-level introduction to our observability strategy.
